. Provide solutions: Don't only identify issues; provide practical recommendations for enhancements instead.
Maintain a balance between constructive and positive feedback. To boost confidence, start with compliments and work your way down to areas that need work. This maintains the discussion's equilibrium and growth-oriented orientation.
For instance:
Try stating something like, "I've noticed that the last three reports were submitted after the deadline," as opposed to, "You're always late with your reports." Is there anything we can do to improve the timeline's management?

4. How to Take Negative Criticism Well:

. Steer clear of defensiveness: Fight the impulse to quarrel or go on the defensive. Rather, engage in active listening and give the criticism some thought before answering. Ask for comments often rather than waiting for official reviews. Actively seek out criticism from mentors, bosses, and colleagues to make sure you're always getting better.
Example: 
When you get criticism regarding your communication style, ask for instances of your approach's failures rather than jumping to defend it right away. This enables you to understand the problem and make improvements.
